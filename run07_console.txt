 WARNINGS AND ERRORS (IF ANY) FOR PROBLEM    1
             
 (WARNING  2) NM-TRAN INFERS THAT THE DATA ARE POPULATION.
             
 (WARNING  79) SIGMA IS USED ON THE RIGHT. WITH A SUBSEQUENT RUN, IF AN
 INITIAL ESTIMATE OF A DIAGONAL BLOCK OF SIGMA IS TO BE COMPUTED BY
 NONMEM, THAT BLOCK WILL BE SET TO AN IDENTITY MATRIX DURING THAT
 COMPUTATION. THIS COULD LEAD TO AN ARITHMETIC EXCEPTION.*
