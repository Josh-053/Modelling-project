find references to justify this statement below:

Vd reduces as ALB increases upon inflammation, as ALB causes more binding to drug preventing it from distribution (and conc of mAb becomes lower as V increases).
CL in mAbs take already long due to size + due to binding to ALB caused by inflammation, mAb in blood is sustained for longer time.

-> to expect: negative correlation btwn V and ALB
